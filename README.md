## General info
The project was developed as an affiliate program that provides conditions for cooperation for advertisers and webmasters.
The benefits are clear to each side:
* for webmasters - convenient and profitable traffic monetization;
* for advertisers - an increase in turnover, new regular customers and an increase in brand awareness;
* for both - a convenient and honest service, which is constantly being improved.
